### Introduction

The Scalastyle plugin for Eclipse integrates the source code analyzer Scalastyle with Eclipse.
<br/>
[Scalastyle](http://www.scalastyle.org) is a development tool
written by Matthew Farwell to help you ensure that your Scala code adheres to a set of coding
standards. Scalastyle does this by inspecting your Scala source code and pointing out
items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Scalastyle distribution
is included with the Scalastyle plugin.

With the Scalastyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems.
Within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View
and source code annotations just as you would see with compiler errors or warnings.

To get started with using Scalastyle in Eclipse, see [Getting Started](eclipse-getting_started.html)
